## üôã Aid Worker Simulation
This is a collaboration project from our second year - second semester in Team Project. The task was to "create a simulation to understand the difficulties an aid worker may have when working with refugees."

## üí¨ Text Based Simulation
The simulation is text based currently follows 2 major scenarios:
- Emotional distress
- Language barriers
The user works through dialogue and can make choices within these scenarios to handle the challenge faced.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information
A key feature in the simulation is that once a scenario is complete, for the specicif way in which a challenge was overcome, there are links and example provided to inform the user and direct them towards how to implelement the solutions in their work. Something we thought important to create a link between the real world scenarios and the simulation world to better give the user an understanding of challenges and ways in which to overcome them.

## üèÜ The Result
The reuslt is a unity application that has currently 2 simulated scenarios:
- Emotional Distress
- Language Barriers
Complete with a pause menu, choices to restart, resume and return to the menu and within the two main scenarios are 2 additional choices for the user on how to handle the challenges that they're facing.

## üìã Pre-Requisites

- unity Installed
- Visual Studio
- Unity Editor 2022.3.29f1

If you want to run the program as it is then:
